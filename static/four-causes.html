Material cause</h3><p>The material that something is made of. For example, the words, characters that are used in a program and ultimately the underlying bits that the binary code is built on.</p><h3>2. Formal cause</h3><p>The form, the shape, the structure, the appearance that something takes. For example, the source code, the syntax, the structure and organization of the program.</p><h3>3. Efficient cause</h3><p>The person or thing whose direct action resulted in a particular the thing. This is a similar concept to the proximate cause. For example, the programmer who wrote the code.</p><h3>4. Final cause</h3><p>The purpose and intention for something. The reason something is the way it is or does what it does. For example, why the code was written; the problem that it solves for the user.</p><h2>Why</h2><p>For <a href='/two-levels-of-understanding'>a deeper understanding</a> of <a href='https://notes.yosevu.com/what-and-why'>what and why</a> something is the way it is or why it does what it does.</p><h2>Sources</h2><ul><li><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes'>Four causes</a></li><li><a href='https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/'>Aristotle on Causality</a></li></ul></article><aside><h4>Links to this note</h4><ul><li><a href="https://notes.yosevu.com/two-levels-of-understanding">Two levels of understanding</a></li><li><a href="https://notes.yosevu.com/what-and-why">What and why</a></li></ul></aside></main><script src="js/highlight.js"></script><script>hljs.highlightAll()</script></div></body></html>
