# Literate programming makes code more accessible

## What

*Literate programming* makes computer programs easier understand by using *natural language* to explain them.

You can understand code [on two levels](/two-levels-of-understanding): shallow and deep.

## Why

Natural language is essential for understanding code because it is [what our brains do best](/what-brains-are-good-for) and it is fundamental to how we think and use language for the most kind of communication: human-to-human.
