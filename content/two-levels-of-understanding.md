# Two levels of understanding

## What
There are two levels of understanding: shallow and deep.

1.  A shallow understanding is about *what* something does on the surface; its [formal cause](/four-causes).
2.  Deep understanding is about *why* something does what it does; its [final cause](/four-causes).
