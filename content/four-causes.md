# Four causes

## What

The four causes are were described by Aristotle as four different ways to answer the question "why?" or "for what reason?" or "because of what"?

Inspired by [Heidegger's description of the four causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes#Technology_(Heidegger's_four_causes)) 

### 1. Material cause

The material that something is made of. For example, the words, characters that are used in a program and ultimately the underlying bits that the binary code is built on.

### 2. Formal cause
The form, the shape, the structure, the appearance that something takes. For example, the source code, the syntax, the structure and organization of the program.

### 3. Efficient cause
The person or thing whose direct action resulted in a particular the thing. This is a similar concept to the proximate cause. For example, the programmer who wrote the code.

### 4. Final cause
The purpose and intention for something. The reason something is the way it is or does what it does. For example, why the code was written; the problem that it solves for the user.

## Why 
For [a deeper understanding](/two-levels-of-understanding) of [what and why](/what-and-why) something is the way it is or why it does what it does.
